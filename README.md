# Advanced-Pig-Game
An advanced version of the classic Pig Game

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn (GlOBAL score remains)
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn

- You may choose the score in the very interface at ANY point of the game.
- The player who rolls two sixes in a row (2 times the number six) loses his current global score and is skipped.
(This does not apply for one instance roll, two rolls have to be made)
